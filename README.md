First day of school. 

Blashke seems like one of the best teachers in the school. Della seems chill. Chan seems chill too. Kitchen is kitchen. William is also chill. Lol no deep description of them, but they all seem like genuine experienced and empathetic teachers. 

A piece of paper broken to multiple pieces of paper being held together by tape. However, each tape was distinct. Some were  stronger and more dense in comparison to other ones. **Torn**

Took a 1 hour nap because idk. Felt a tiny bit dizzy and got a headache. Thankful, tho cuz now I think ik wat to write in my poem :D. I woke up with many things wanting to write in my diary. But now I don't want to.

I have so many questions, but I will allow them to be unanswered. Answers will appear as life passes by and if it doesn't then even then it is an answer.

All the worldâ€™s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances
And one teen in his time plays many parts
His act being seven chapters:
At first, living under the pretense of societal norms; people pleaser,
Following the herd like a lost sheep,
And reserving all emotions no matter what was thrown at him
To blindly lose himself.
Then the love fever
Head in the clouds
To smile around adversity at the mere thought
To understand true anxiety
Cultivation of self-hate 
To blindly lose himself
The arrow struck,
And the hole quickly filled with blame and anger
Searching imperfections and errors in every decision
To blindly lose himself
